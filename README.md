# Card Matching Game with Bean Tutorial
This is a tutorial based on the first 3 [Stanford iOS 7 lectures and assignments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqKbN_C4Yvg&list=PL9qPUrlLU4jSlonxFqhWKBu2c_sWY-mzg&index=1). I incorporated Punch Through's [Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean-from-wireframe), such that when the Bean is shaken very hard, it reshuffles the deck.  I used the Bean's [iOS SDK](https://github.com/PunchThrough/Bean-iOS-OSX-SDK) so that my program knows how to communicate to the Bean.  The reference documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://punchthrough.com/files/bean/sdk-docs/index.html).

To learn how to use the Bean, visit the [Getting started guide](#)

I used some classes not mentioned in the lectures, which I will go over during the tutorial.
